## Motivation

According to the safety organization Kids and Cars, an average of 37 kids die each year in hot cars. Death in summers are prevalent due to increased heat. On August 5th, 2017, a grandmother left a 4-year old girl inside an SUV when she had thought that she dropped off the girl off at daycare. These types of situations where a parent or guardian forgets a child due to a lapse in memory is all too common. In 10 minutes, the temperature in a car can increase up to 20 degrees. Therefore, a wireless system in the car that promptly notifies the guardian about a left child is essential.
